/**
 * The frozen wire samples under `team-hub/contract/`.
 *
 * Protocol amendment A4 point 9 freezes one request and one response example per
 * Host endpoint in the hub's own repository (`team-hub/contract/<interface>.json`),
 * plus the WebSocket handshake and the event catalogue, and both sides test
 * against the same files so a drift on either side fails a test. This module is
 * the fake hub's reading half: it loads the samples, matches one outgoing call to
 * its sample by method and path template, and compares what the provider actually
 * sent with what the sample shows.
 *
 * The samples are EXAMPLES, not schemas, so the comparison is deliberately
 * two-sided with three named allowances: a member the specification makes optional
 * may be absent (`OPTIONAL_BODY_KEYS`), a member whose interior is the Host's own
 * document is compared only as an object (`OPEN_MEMBERS`), and a member the
 * example shows as `null` is nullable, so any value is accepted there.
 *
 * The comparison is recursive. An object is compared member by member at every
 * depth, and an array element by element: an element may only carry the members
 * the example used somewhere in that array, and MUST carry the ones every example
 * element showed. That is what catches a renamed field inside `agents[]` or an
 * issue object that lost a member, instead of only checking the outermost keys.
 *
 * `Authorization` values in the samples are placeholders, so only the header's
 * presence and its `Bearer ` prefix are compared.
 *
