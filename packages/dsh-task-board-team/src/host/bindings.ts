/**
 * Which local agents this Host registers with the hub.
 *
 * dsh-agents owns the member definitions and writes them to
 * `$DSH_HOME/dsh-agents/ledger.json`; it serves no cordis service for them, so
 * this module reads that ledger file directly, read-only and tolerantly. A
 * missing file, an unreadable one, or a document from another revision leaves
 * the binding list empty and reports why — the Host keeps running, it simply
 * claims nothing, which is the safe direction for a machine that would
 * otherwise execute somebody else's work.
 *
 * The binding itself is a member id: the name, preset and workspace always come
 * from the member definition, never from the browser, so a settings edit can
 * point at a member but cannot invent one.
