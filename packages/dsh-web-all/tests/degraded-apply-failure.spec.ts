/**
 * Apply-stage failure ledger contract (issue #1850).
 *
 * The shell captures a family plugin's start failure in two places: the
 * synchronous throw out of ctx.plugin() and the rejection of the fiber it
 * returns. Only the first has a fixture (fixtures/throwing-row.ts) and a spec
 * today, so the async half is unpinned: deleting the fiber-rejection handler
 * leaves the whole suite green while a row whose apply awaits before failing
 * disappears from the ledger — exactly the "import ok, apply threw" class this
 * contract exists for, and the reason a degraded panel reads an empty ledger.
