/**
 * When a finished turn may be announced: after the family it belongs to falls
 * quiet, not when the frame arrives.
 *
 * A `turn/end` increment is a fact about one turn and nothing more. The work the
 * user started with it may still be going: the subagent sessions the host spawned
 * under it at any depth, and the background jobs the host still holds under any of
 * them, outlive the turn that started them. A phone told "turn finished" at the
 * frame wakes on a roster that still badges a session running, reads a card that
 * says ended while the work goes on, and is told again by a second turn end it
 * never asked for. §28's notification and §29's card answer the same question — "is
 * this work still going" — and that question has one answer, the family's.
 *
 * The family is the root a session's parent chain climbs to, plus every session
 * under that root at any depth. A leaf session's own turn end therefore waits for
 * the root and for the siblings and cousins it shares that root with, which is the
 * work the user actually started. So a turn end is registered here instead of sent,
 * and sent once the host says the family is quiet. Three rules hold that together:
 *
 * - the answer comes from the host and nowhere else: one `session/list` read for the
 *   running flags, the parent chain and each session's origin, and the host's job
 *   registry for the jobs it attributes to a session. This module invents no
 *   timer-based guess and reads no client state, because a guess that says "quiet"
 *   is a lock screen saying the work finished when it did not;
 * - nothing on the frame path waits: a registration stores five fields and arms a
 *   timer, so a follow stream still publishes its increment at the speed it did
 *   before;
 * - the wait has no deadline. A family that stays busy is never announced, and a
 *   host that cannot answer is asked again rather than read as quiet: announcing
 *   work that is still running is the failure this channel exists to prevent, and a
 *   notification that never arrives is the lesser one. One line at
 *   {@link TURN_END_QUIET_REPORT_MS} says the bridge is still waiting, so an
 *   operator is not left guessing why a phone stayed silent.
 *
 * Not every turn end is the phone's to hear. A session the host spawned as a
 * subagent (`origin: "subagent"`) ends turns nobody asked this bridge about, so its
 * turn end is dropped on its first answer unless the phone itself prompted that
 * session over the wire.
