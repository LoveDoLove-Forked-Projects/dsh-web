/**
 * The Live Activity half of the push channel (protocol §29).
 *
 * The alert channel in `core/push.ts` tells a phone something happened; a Live
 * Activity is the lock-screen card that keeps being right while the app is
 * suspended, which is why it is a second payload with its own rules rather than
 * a field on the first one:
 *
 * - the request is a `liveactivity` push to a per-card APNs token, under the app
 *   bundle's `.push-type.liveactivity` topic, with `apns-expiration: 0` — a card
 *   update that arrives late is a lie about the present, so it is never resent;
 * - `content-state` is the App's own `SessionActivityState`, decoded with
 *   ActivityKit's default Codable strategy. Timestamps in it are seconds since
 *   Apple's reference date (2001-01-01T00:00:00Z), never Unix seconds: a Unix
 *   number decodes as a date decades away and the whole card fails to decode;
 * - one card shows one session. A registered card names its session, a card
 *   without one is never pushed to, and a state is delivered to the cards whose
 *   session it is about — never to "all cards", because that is how one session's
 *   question ends up on another session's lock screen (§29.9). `runningCount` is
 *   the one bridge-wide number on a card, and it stays the total on purpose;
 * - one card lays out at most three rows (§30). The address is still one session
 *   per card — rows say what that card has to tell, not who it is sent to — and
 *   every card is given them the same way: the sessions waiting on the user
 *   first, in the order their questions arrived, then the sessions running now,
 *   most recently updated first. A row's name is the host's own title with its
 *   trailing path group taken off, because §29.5 keeps paths off a lock screen;
 * - a card that would say what the card before it already said is not sent, one
 *   activity takes at most one update per `LIVE_ACTIVITY_INTERVAL_MS`, and
 *   the whole bridge at most `LIVE_ACTIVITY_PER_MINUTE` a minute. What does
 *   not fit is dropped, never queued: a card is a snapshot of now, and a backlog
 *   of stale snapshots is exactly what this channel must not deliver.
 *
 * Nothing here is awaited by a frame path. Every entry point returns before a
 * delivery starts, and a failure — connection, 401, 410, 5xx, timeout — is one
 * log line and a dropped card, never a delayed or broken follow stream (§28.5).
