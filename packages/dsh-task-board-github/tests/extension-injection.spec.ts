/**
 * The provider's wiring under a REAL cordis registry.
 *
 * This suite exists because of a real defect: the aggregate mounts plugin
 * children without ordering their applies, so the board's `taskBoard` service
 * is frequently published AFTER this extension activates. A one-shot
 * "resolve it now, and give up forever if it is missing" lookup left every seat
 * permanently absent under a real aggregate load, with nothing but a console
 * warning to show for it.
 *
 * The wiring therefore lives behind a cordis dependency scope. These cases
 * drive that scope through a real `Context`: the board service is published
 * and withdrawn with `provide`, and every assertion is about what the operator
 * ends up with — seats, provider registrations, tools and published summaries.
