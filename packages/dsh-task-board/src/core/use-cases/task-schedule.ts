/**
 * Schedule use cases: arm/disarm a task's scheduling rule, and record what a

 * — the controller orchestrates those). Validation and next-run computation
 * live here, sharing the core cron parser (schedule.ts) and the withSchedule
 * transition.
 *
 * A rule is either a recurring cron rule or a single planned instant, and
 * either kind may be capped by a run budget. The counter (`runCount`) moves
 * only when the Host actually opened an execution; a skipped occurrence
 * (busy, unconfirmed permission, missed instant, unreachable plan) moves the
 * rule without consuming its budget.
